# Packet Tracer Align To Grid

Cisco Packet Tracer is a great tool for learning about networking (and more).

One shortcoming with it is that when you place/move devices in the logical workspace, they are very difficult to align and so your network topologies look unprofessional.

Packet Tracer has an option called *Align logical workspace objects* which attempts to offer some alignment as you move devices. The problem is, it doesn't work properly and often makes things worse.

Introducing **Packet Tracer Align To Grid**!
